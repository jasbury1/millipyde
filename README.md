# Millipyde

## About

Millipyde is a cross-platform framework for transparent acceleration on the GPU. It is written on top of AMD's ROCm platform.
See the written thesis (/thesis/Millipyde_Thesis.pdf) for an in-depth description of the project and its contribution to the Python GPU programming ecosystem.
The full API can be seen at the end of the thesis.

## How to Use

Use the the build.sh script for AMD platforms, and the nvidia_build.sh script for ROCm environments with an NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA runtime.
Requires a ROCm compatible GPU
